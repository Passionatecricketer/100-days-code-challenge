       "A group of girlfriends is on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads: \"For Women Only.\" Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in. The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. \"We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. It's easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you what's inside.\" So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads: \"All the men on this floor are short and plain.\" The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. The sign on the second floor reads: \"All the men here are short and handsome.\" Still, this isn't good enough, so the friends continue on up. They reach the third floor and the sign reads: \"All the men here are tall and plain.\" They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up. On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect: \"All the men here are tall and handsome.\" The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. There they find a sign that reads: \"There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.\"    3.726507\n",
       "A couple of hunters are out in the woods in the deep south when one of them falls to the ground. He doesn't seem to be breathing, and his eyes are rolled back in his head. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911. He gasps to the operator, \"My friend is dead! What can I do?\" The operator, in a calm and soothing voice, says, \"Alright, take it easy. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead.\" There is silence, and then a gun shot is heard. The hunter comes back on the line. \"Okay.

       "An explorer in the deepest Amazon suddenly finds himself surrounded by a bloodthirsty group of natives. Upon surveying the situation, he says quietly to himself, \"Oh God, I'm screwed.\" The sky darkens and a voice booms out, \"No, you are NOT screwed.

He stands above the lifeless body, breathing heavily and looking at 100 angry natives...
